## Task summary  
The main task of the project was to implement a set of different machine learning algorithms in Flink's Streaming Environment using the Parameter Server and pipeline paradigms and evaluating the results afterwards. 

algorithms consists of:

1.  Online Support Vector Machine (OSVM) 
2.  Online Ridge Regression (ORR) 
3.  Lasso w/ Shrinkage via Limit of Gibbs Sampling (SLOG) 
4.  Asynchronous Stochastic Variational Inference (ASVI) 
5.  Growing Gaussian Mixture Model (GGMM)
